# Task 4.1
- thresholding HSV color values seemed to work better than RGB
- the threshold range required to track the object was larger than expected
  - range was > 100 for each value

# Task 4.2
After applying a flashlight, there was actually not a significant difference in the tracking ability of my object. I suspect that if I used an object that wasn't as reflective, it would have had a larger impact.

# Task 4.3
Changing the brightness of my phone greatly affected the tracking ability of the color picker. Both at the dimmest and brightest setting of my phone, my program was unable to track the color picker.

# Task 4.4
My phone was more robust to brightness. I suspect that since it has it's own LED's that emit light, the brightness of the external world affects it less than an actual object.

A short blurb about graphics for our project:

Initially, we are going to build our game using pygame, so this lab was really
helpful for us going forward into our project. On the side, I'll be looking
into Unity to upgrade possibly make our game more graphically pleasing if we
have time to do that.

For the lab, I partnered up with Bruce.

Screenshots are in the github repo.
